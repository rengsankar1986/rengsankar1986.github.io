Housing Market Prediction Analysis


DSC630 Predictive Analysis
Sri R Sankaranarayanan

Introduction :- 

Purchasing a house is a big decision in a person’s life and needs a considerable amount of thought and research. As a first-time amateur home buyer, I am looking to develop this project on my own personal interest to see how the housing prices in the near future is heading in various given metro cities in the USA. As we all know the current pandemic has driven the housing market so crazy and it is simply unaffordable for many young American families to dream about owning their first time, especially in cities like Dallas, Austin, Denver, Houston, Phoenix and few other major metro cities. 

Business Problem :- 

House price prediction is a significant financial decision for individuals. One would want to buy their first home or invest on real estate properties at the best rate and minimum risk and would like that to be the best investment for future. We are aiming to predict the housing price based on the historical Sale Price, Median Income, Number of Schools and their Rating, Crime Rate, Unemployment Rate, Number of Hospitals and their ratings.

Scope/problem Statements:- 

1.	What does the analysis/model building tell you?
2.	What are the recommendations?
3.	What will be the predicted price per square foot of a home in a given zip code/ county in the next few months? 
4.	Predict the price based on crime rates, schools and other information/metrics provided by Zillow for a zip code/neighborhood/county?
5.	Lastly, Is 2022 a good year to buy a house?

The aim of the project is to provide the best counties/areas in the USA to invest in for a national real estate developer, individual buyers, banks looking for a place to develop a new apartment building or to purchase. Another goal is to predict the house prices in a county in the next few months.

We are trying to predict the house prices using Machine learning algorithms XGBoost and Linear Regression considering factors such as Median income in a county, Crime rate in that county, public schools, hospitals, hospital ratings and unemployment rate in the county.
