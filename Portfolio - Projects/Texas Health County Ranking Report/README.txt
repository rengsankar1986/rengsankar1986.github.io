The statistical questions for the project are: 

1. Health Outcomes: Everyone wants to experience long and healthy lives, yet places have different resources and opportunities. To understand the health outcomes in a community, we measure both length and quality of life by county within Texas.

2. Is there a significant statistical difference between rural and urban single parent households?  Do Texas rural counties have a higher proportion of single parent households than urban counties?

3. Are high school graduation rates along with reading and writing scores better in urban schools?  There is a myth that urban schools, or more specifically affluent suburban schools, are better than rural schools. Unfortunately, the dataset does not include this category only Urban and Rural.
