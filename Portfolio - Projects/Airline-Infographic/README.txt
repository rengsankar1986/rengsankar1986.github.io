Infographic Details
The infographic is intended for external audience. The idea is to project positive message about airlines safety and support that with data, while making it appealing and easily understandable for the public.
The title of the infographic articulates what the graphics is all about â€“ Air Travel Safety. The first section does a comparison of how other transportation mediums compare with airlines. This is important since the audience, who have travelled in different transport mediums, find it intuitive to compare and figure out where different transportation mediums stands in terms of statistics. The per billion death for air travel between 2000-2009 stands out at 0.07 and 0.03% where other common transport mediums are much higher. The external data source for this statistic is cited in the reference section.
The next section for accident trends in air travel shows an impressive decrease of 53.7% over the last 10 years (2000-2008). A trend line is the easiest way to make this statistic easy to digest. I have used external data for this and the data source is cited in the reference section.
The next section stresses on the common pattern between the most accident-prone airlines. We see that all of them are from third world countries. This gives a message that economy and subsequent development of technology and safety measure has a correlation with incidents. The last section reiterates the fact and highlights the worst and the best airlines in terms of number of incidents since 1985. The dataset provided for the project was used for the last two visuals. 
Complicated statistical comparison between different aspects of aircraft incident and fatalities are avoided in the context since they will seem repetitive and uninteresting to the audience (as they can be from outside of the airlines industry).
