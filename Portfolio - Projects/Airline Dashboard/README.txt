Final Project Presentation Paper
For the final presentation, Since I not much familiar with Video presentation/Video editing and UI/UX, I have chosen Power Point presentation with voice over. I tried to provide the background and explain what is at stake, show supporting data points and present the big idea as well as highlight my companyâ€™s position in the same perspective.

To depict The latest Buzz in the market I presented news articles and discussions both for and against air travel safety. Since there are a lot of factors involved when it comes to safety, I tried to unravel the different aspects throughout the presentation, such as open safety culture, training mandates for pilots and stewards etc.

I have tried my best to articulate few data points such as comparative analysis of different modes of transportation, fatality trend of air travel and past accident statistics. I have drawn reference of IATA, their safety statistics, aircraft details and how all these impacts the fictional XYZ airlines position in the market. IATA or International Air Transport Association supports aviation with global standards for airline safety, security, efficiency and sustainability. XYZ airlines is part of IATA and the data here shows an outstanding safety characteristic for IATA members. Moreover, XYZ Airlines uses Boeing 717 for most of its flights. 717 is one of the top 9 aircrafts in the world in terms of safety.

My Summary : From the data points collected, the statistics indicates air travel is the safest means of transportation in the modern world. And XYZ airlines is one of the top airlines as far as safety measure is concerned. Therefore, confidently choose XYZ airlines for a safe and reliable travel experience.
