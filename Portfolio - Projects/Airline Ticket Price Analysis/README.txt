Business Problem :- 
Airline companies use complex algorithms to calculate flight prices given various conditions present at that particular time. These methods take financial, marketing, and various social factors into account to predict flight prices. It is difficult for airlines to maintain prices since prices change dynamically due to different conditions. That’s why we will try to use machine learning to solve this problem. This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain. It can also help customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journey accordingly.
Background/History :
This project is combining both my passion for travelling and Data Science to find cheap ticket price. Flight price analysis in Airline Transportation is a complex phenomenon and requires frequently checking through travel websites for deals based on preferences. The Objective of this project is to perform Web Scraping on Kayak.com to predict flight prices and send an email alert to my personal gmail. My target variable will be the price (continuous numeric value).  
Data Explanation :- 
I will be scraping through kayak.com websites for current pricing data in real-time (web scraping technique explained below), below will be the datasets that I am going to be procuring in real-time.
Airline: This column will have all the types of airlines like Delta, Emirates, Jet Airways, Air India, and many more operating through my input routes.
Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the passenger’s journey will start.

Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers wanted to travel.
Route: Here we can know about that what is the route through which passengers have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.
Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.
Duration: Duration is the whole period that a flight will take to complete its journey from source to destination.
Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for the flight in the whole journey.
Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food, and other amenities.
