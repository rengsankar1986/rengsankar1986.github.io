## About Me

I wasn't always in love with science, but when I had to take a biology course (required to wrap up my business degree) I was set on a new path. I extended my university stay a couple more years, following a newfound fascination though pursuit of a biotechnology degree. This got me a job in the sciences, where I've spent almost 20 years, first in quality testing and then on to vaccine development and production.

In the interim, I continued to explore other paths: becoming a master gardener, learning about prairie management, taking up beekeeping, and trying my hand at brewing beer and even mead.

Eventually I came to a realization that not everyone loves playing around with spreadsheets as much as I do. That, coupled with a general penchant for technology, presented me an opportunity in the form of data science. So at the same time the pandemic was ramping up, I began taking classes, ultimately wrapping up a Masters in Data Science in August 2022.

Now it's time to see where these new tools might lead me.
