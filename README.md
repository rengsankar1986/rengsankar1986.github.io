I am a Biologist and budding Data Scientist versed in Machine Learning and Data Visualization using Python, R, Power BI

## Portfolio

Here's some of my selected work:
1. **[Cornhusker Football and Public Safety](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Football-Safety)**  
    Use R for analysis of crime and traffic incidents in Lincoln, NE on Cornhusker game weekends compared to non-game weekends.
1. **[Nebraska Breweries](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/NE-Breweries)**  
    Use Python for scraping tables on the web to collect data. Cleaning data and combining using SQL joins. Standardization of addresses and phone numbers, and geographic mapping of brewery locations.
1. **[Microbe Identification](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Microbe-Identification)**  
    Use of Machine Learning in Python for automated classification of microbes from an imbalanced dataset to aid in rapid identification of microbes.
1. **[Airline Safety Infographic](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Airline-Infographic)**  
    Infographic demonstrating the safety of flight as a travel option, from the perspective of an airline customer.
1. **[Immigration Ancestry and Income](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Income-Ancestry)**  
    Python analysis to determine whether having grandparents born outside of the US impacts the income of an individual or family.
1. **[Bean Classification using ML](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Beans-Classification)**  
    Multiclass classification of 7 bean species based on measurements. Includes EDA, visualization, standardization, feature selection, and evaluation of several models, including hyperparameter tuning.
1. **[Airline Safety Dashboard](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Airline-Dashboard)**  
    Use of Power BI for interactive dashboard showing summary of airline flights and accidents over time and by flight type, aircraft type, and location.
1. **[Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Stroke-Prediction)**  
    Binary classification in Python to predict stroke in patients using Machine Learning with patient data. Includes multiple model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensembles.
1. **[Housing Price Modeling](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Housing-Prices)**  
    Use R for analysis of several predictive models of housing prices using groups of features generated previously through feature selection methods in Python.
1. **[AI Text Generation](https://github.com/ScottBreitbach/ScottBreitbach.github.io/tree/main/Portfolio-Projects/Text-Generation)**  
    Implement LSTM text generator with Tensorflow and Keras using Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy corpus.


## About Me

I wasn't always in love with science, but when I had to take a biology course (required to wrap up my business degree) I was set on a new path. I extended my university stay a couple more years, following a newfound fascination though pursuit of a biotechnology degree. This got me a job in the sciences, where I've spent almost 20 years, first in quality testing and then on to vaccine development and production.

In the interim, I continued to explore other paths: becoming a master gardener, learning about prairie management, taking up beekeeping, and trying my hand at brewing beer and even mead.

Eventually I came to a realization that not everyone loves playing around with spreadsheets as much as I do. That, coupled with a general penchant for technology, presented me an opportunity in the form of data science. So at the same time the pandemic was ramping up, I began taking classes, ultimately wrapping up a Masters in Data Science in August 2022.

Now it's time to see where these new tools might lead me.
